oregami-server
============================
open source game database

This is the web client written in JavaScript and HTML.
It uses AngularJS (http://angularjs.org/).

Open "index.html" in the folder "app", after you have started the server (https://github.com/oregami/oregami-server).
The client tries to access the server at http://localhost:8080, if you changed the server config (host, port) then change the client configuration in "app/scripts/app.js" (search for "constant('mySettings'...").
